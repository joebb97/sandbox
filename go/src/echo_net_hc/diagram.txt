TCP Connection comes with two sides (two network sockets / file descriptors)

        R/W
Client ------> Server

        R/W
Client <------ Server

Normal close is when both R/W are closed at the same time over a link. Normally both sides do this at the same time.

Half close is when one of either R/W are closed. Normally both sides do this one at a time
