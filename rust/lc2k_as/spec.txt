1. Purpose

This project is intended to help you understand the instructions of a very
simple assembly language and how to assemble programs into machine language.

2. Problem

This project has three parts.  In the first part, you will write a program
to take an assembly-language program and produce the corresponding machine
language.  In the second part, you will write a behavioral simulator for
the resulting machine code.  In the third part, you will write a short
assembly-language program to multiply two numbers.

3. LC-2K Instruction-Set Architecture

In this and several of the following projects, you will be gradually "building"
the LC-2K (Little Computer 2000). The LC-2K is very simple, but it is general
enough to solve complex problems. For this project, you will only need to
know the instruction set and instruction format of the LC-2K.

The LC-2K is an 8-register, 32-bit computer.  All addresses are
word-addresses.  The LC-2K has 65536 words of memory.  By assembly-language
convention, register 0 will always contain 0 (i.e. the machine will not enforce
this, but no assembly-language program should ever change register 0 from its
initial value of 0).

There are 4 instruction formats (bit 0 is the least-significant bit).  Bits
31-25 are unused for all instructions, and should always be 0.

R-type instructions (add, nor):
    bits 24-22: opcode
    bits 21-19: reg A
    bits 18-16: reg B
    bits 15-3:  unused (should all be 0)
    bits 2-0:   destReg

I-type instructions (lw, sw, beq):
    bits 24-22: opcode
    bits 21-19: reg A
    bits 18-16: reg B
    bits 15-0:  offsetField (a 16-bit, 2's complement number with a range of
                    -32768 to 32767)

J-type instructions (jalr):
    bits 24-22: opcode
    bits 21-19: reg A
    bits 18-16: reg B
    bits 15-0:  unused (should all be 0)

O-type instructions (halt, noop):
    bits 24-22: opcode
    bits 21-0:  unused (should all be 0)

add (R-type format)     000                     Add contents of regA with
                                                contents of regB, store
                                                results in destReg.

nor (R-type format)     001                     Nor contents of regA with
                                                contents of regB, store
                                                results in destReg.  This is
                                                a bitwise nor; each bit is
                                                treated independently.

lw (I-type format)      010                     Load regB from memory. Memory
                                                address is formed by adding
                                                offsetField with the contents
                                                of regA.

sw (I-type format)      011                     Store regB into memory. Memory
                                                address is formed by adding
                                                offsetField with the contents
                                                of regA.

beq (I-type format)     100                     If the contents of regA
                                                and regB are the same,
                                                then branch to the address
                                                PC+1+offsetField,
                                                where PC is the address
                                                of this beq instruction.

jalr (J-type format)    101                     First store PC+1 into regB, 
                                                where PC is the address of this 
                                                jalr instruction. Then branch to 
                                                the address contained in regA. 
                                                Note that this implies if regA 
                                                and regB refer to the same register, 
                                                the net effect will be jumping to PC+1.

halt (O-type format)    110                     Increment the PC (as with all
                                                instructions), then halt the
                                                machine (let the simulator
                                                notice that the machine
                                                halted).

noop (O-type format)    111                     Do nothing.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. LC-2K Assembly Language and Assembler (40%)

The first part of this project is to write a program to take an
assembly-language program and translate it into machine language. You will
translate assembly-language names for instructions, such as beq, into their
numeric equivalent (e.g. 100), and you will translate symbolic names for
addresses into numeric values. The final output will be a series of 32-bit
instructions (instruction bits 31-25 are always 0).

The format for a line of assembly code is (<white> means a series of tabs
and/or spaces):

label<white>instruction<white>field0<white>field1<white>field2<white>comments

The leftmost field on a line is the label field.  Valid labels contain a
maximum of 6 characters and can consist of letters and numbers (but must start
with a letter). The label is optional (the white space following the label
field is required).  Labels make it much easier to write assembly-language
programs, since otherwise you would need to modify all address fields each time
you added a line to your assembly-language program!

After the optional label is white space.  Then follows the instruction field,
where the instruction can be any of the assembly-language instruction names
listed in the above table.  After more white space comes a series of fields.
All fields are given as decimal numbers or labels.  The number of fields
depends on the instruction, and unused fields should be ignored (treat them
like comments).

    R-type instructions (add, nor) instructions require 3 fields: field0
    is regA, field1 is regB, and field2 is destReg.

    I-type instructions (lw, sw, beq) require 3 fields: field0 is regA, field1
    is regB, and field2 is either a numeric value for offsetField or a symbolic
    address.  Numeric offsetFields can be positive or negative; symbolic
    addresses are discussed below.

    J-type instructions (jalr) require 2 fields: field0 is regA, and field1 is
    regB.

    O-type instructions (noop and halt) require no fields.

Symbolic addresses refer to labels.  For lw or sw instructions, the assembler
should compute offsetField to be equal to the address of the label.  This could
be used with a zero base register to refer to the label, or could be used with
a non-zero base register to index into an array starting at the label.  For beq
instructions, the assembler should translate the label into the numeric
offsetField needed to branch to that label.

After the last used field comes more white space, then any comments.  The
comment field ends at the end of a line.  Comments are vital to creating
understandable assembly-language programs, because the instructions themselves
are rather cryptic.

All valid LC-2K programs must have a newline character at the end of each line.
Some text editors enforce this for the last line of the file, and some do not.
Failing to have a newline on the last line of assembly code can lead to strange
bugs that can be quite difficult to find.  Thus, be sure to end your assembly
language files with newlines.  In many editors, you can guarantee this by putting
a blank line at the end of the file, and then deleting the blank line.  Leaving a
blank line in place is not recommended, as this will typically cause assembly
to fail with an "unrecognized opcode" error.

In addition to LC-2K instructions, an assembly-language program may contain
directions for the assembler. The only assembler directive we will use is .fill
(note the leading period). .fill tells the assembler to put a number into the
place where the instruction would normally be stored. .fill instructions use
one field, which can be either a numeric value or a symbolic address.  For
example, ".fill 32" puts the value 32 where the instruction would normally be
stored.  .fill with a symbolic address will store the address of the label.
In the example below, ".fill start" will store the value 2, because the label
"start" is at address 2. The bounds of the numeric value for .fill instructions
are -2^31 to +2^31-1 (-2147483648 to 2147483647).

The assembler should make two passes over the assembly-language program. In the
first pass, it will calculate the address for every symbolic label.  Assume
that the first instruction is at address 0.  In the second pass, it will
generate a machine-language instruction (in decimal) for each line of assembly
language.  For example, here is an assembly-language program (that counts down
from 5, stopping when it hits 0).

        lw      0       1       five    load reg1 with 5 (symbolic address)
        lw      1       2       3       load reg2 with -1 (numeric address)
start   add     1       2       1       decrement reg1
        beq     0       1       2       goto end of program when reg1==0
        beq     0       0       start   go back to the beginning of the loop
        noop
done    halt                            end of program
five    .fill   5
neg1    .fill   -1
stAddr  .fill   start                   will contain the address of start (2)

And here is the corresponding machine language:

(address 0): 8454151 (hex 0x810007)
(address 1): 9043971 (hex 0x8a0003)
(address 2): 655361 (hex 0xa0001)
(address 3): 16842754 (hex 0x1010002)
(address 4): 16842749 (hex 0x100fffd)
(address 5): 29360128 (hex 0x1c00000)
(address 6): 25165824 (hex 0x1800000)
(address 7): 5 (hex 0x5)
(address 8): -1 (hex 0xffffffff)
(address 9): 2 (hex 0x2)

Be sure you understand how the above assembly-language program got translated
to machine language.

Since your programs will always start at address 0, your program should only
output the contents, not the addresses.

4.1. Running Your Assembler

Write your program to take two command-line arguments.  The first argument is
the file name where the assembly-language program is stored, and the second
argument is the file name where the output (the machine-code) is written.
For example, with a program name of "assemble", an assembly-language program
in "program.as", the following would generate a machine-code file "program.mc":

    assemble program.as program.mc

Note that the format for running the command must use command-line arguments
for the file names (rather than standard input and standard output).  Your
program should store only the list of decimal numbers in the machine-code
file, one instruction per line. The decimal numbers will range from -2^31 to
+2^31-1 (-2147483648 to 2147483647). Any deviation from this format (e.g. extra
spaces or empty lines) will render your machine-code file ungradeable.  Any
other output that you want the program to generate (e.g. debugging output) can
be printed to standard output.

4.2. Error Checking

Your assembler should catch the following errors in the assembly-language
program: use of undefined labels, duplicate labels, offsetFields that don't fit
in 16 bits, and unrecognized opcodes.  Your assembler should exit(1) if it
detects an error and exit(0) if it finishes without detecting any errors.  Your
assembler should NOT catch simulation-time errors, i.e. errors that would occur
at the time the assembly-language program executes (e.g. branching to address
-1, infinite loops, etc.).

4.3. Test Cases

An integral (and graded) part of writing your assembler will be to write a
suite of test cases to validate any LC-2K assembler.  This is common practice
in the real world--software companies maintain a suite of test cases for their
programs and use this suite to check the program's correctness after a change.
Writing a comprehensive suite of test cases will deepen your understanding of
the project specification and your program, and it will help you a lot as you
debug your program.

The test cases for the assembler part of this project will be short
assembly-language programs that serve as input to an assembler.  You will
submit your suite of test cases together with your assembler, and we will grade
your test suite according to how thoroughly it exercises an assembler.  Each
test case may be at most 50 lines long, and your test suite may contain up to
20 test cases.  These limits are much larger than needed for full credit (the
solution test suite is composed of 5 test cases, each < 10 lines long).  See
Section 7 for how your test suite will be graded.

Hints: the example assembly-language program above is a good case to include
in your test suite, though you'll need to write more test cases to get full
credit.  Remember to create some test cases that test the ability of an
assembler to check for the errors in Section 4.2.

4.4. Assembler Hints

Since offsetField is a 2's complement number, it can only store numbers ranging
from -32768 to 32767.  For symbolic addresses, your assembler will compute
offsetField so that the instruction refers to the correct label.

Remember that offsetField is only a 16-bit 2's complement number.  Since Linux
integers are 32 bits, you'll have to chop off all but the lowest 16 bits for
negative values of offsetField.

5. Behavioral Simulator (40%)

The second part of this assignment is to write a program that can simulate any
legal LC-2K machine-code program.  The input for this part will be the
machine-code file that you created with your assembler.  With a program name
of "simulate" and a machine-code file of "program.mc", your program should be
run as follows:

    simulate program.mc > output

This directs all printfs to the file "output".

The simulator should begin by initializing all registers and the program
counter to 0.  The simulator will then simulate the program until the program
executes a halt.

The simulator should call printState (included below) before executing each
instruction and once just before exiting the program.  This function prints the
current state of the machine (program counter, registers, memory).  printState
will print the memory contents for memory locations defined in the machine-code
file (addresses 0-9 in the Section 4 example).

5.1 Test Cases

As with the assembler, you will write a suite of test cases to validate any
LC-2K simulator.

The test cases for the simulator part of this project will be short, valid
assembly-language programs that, after being assembled into machine code, serve
as input to a simulator.  You will submit your suite of test cases together
with your simulator, and we will grade your test suite according to how
thoroughly it exercises an LC-2K simulator.  Each test case may execute at
most 200 instructions on a correct simulator, and your test suite may contain
up to 20 test cases.  These limits are much larger than needed for full credit
(the solution test suite is composed of a couple test cases, each executing
less than 40 instructions).  See Section 7 for how your test suite will be
graded.

5.2. Simulator Hints

Be careful how you handle offsetField for lw, sw, and beq. Remember that it's
a 2's complement 16-bit number, so you need to convert a negative offsetField
to a negative 32-bit integer on the Linux workstations (by sign extending it).
One way to do this is to use the following function:

    int
    convertNum(int num)
    {
        /* convert a 16-bit number into a 32-bit Linux integer */
        if (num & (1<<15) ) {
            num -= (1<<16);
        }
        return(num);
    }

An example run of the simulator (not for the specified task of multiplication)
is included at the end of this posting.

6. Assembly-Language Multiplication (20%)

The third part of this assignment is to write an assembly-language program to
multiply two numbers.  Input the numbers by reading memory locations called
"mcand" and "mplier".  The result should be stored in register 1 when the
program halts.  You may assume that the two input numbers are at most 15 bits
and are positive; this ensures that the (positive) result fits in an LC-2K
word. Remember that shifting left by one bit is the same as adding the number
to itself.  Given the LC-2K instruction set, it's easiest to modify the
algorithm so that you avoid the right shift.  Submit a version of the program
that computes (32766 * 10383).

Your multiplication program must be reasonably efficient--it must be at most
50 lines long and execute at most 1000 instructions for any valid input (this
is several times longer and slower than the solution).  To achieve this,
you are strongly encouraged to consider using a loop and shift algorithm
to perform the multiplication; algorithms such as successive addition
(e.g. multiplying 5 * 6 by adding 5 six times) will take too long.

7. Grading, Auto-Grading, and Formatting

We will grade primarily on functionality, including error handling, correctly
assembling and simulating all instructions, input and output format, method of
executing your program, correctly multiplying, and comprehensiveness of the
test suites.

To help you validate your project, your submission will be graded automatically,
and the result will be mailed back to you.  You may then continue to work on the
project and re-submit.  To deter you from using the autograder as a debugger,
you will receive feedback from the autograder only for the first THREE
SUBMISSIONS on any given day.  That is, you will receive an e-mail with your
score only three times on any given day.  All subsequent submissions will be
silently graded.  Your final score will be derived from your overall best
submission to the autograder.

The feedback from the autograder will not be very illuminating; it won't tell
you where your problem is or give you the test programs.  The purpose of the
autograder is to let you know that you should keep working on your project
(rather than thinking it's perfect and ending up with a 0).  The best way to
debug your program is to generate your own test cases, figure out the correct
answers, and compare your program's output to the correct answer.  This is also
one of the best ways to learn the concepts in the project.

The student suite of test cases for the assembler and simulator parts of this
project will be graded according to how thoroughly they test an LC-2K
assembler or simulator.  We will judge thoroughness of the test suite by how
well it exposes potential bugs in an assembler or simulator.

For the assembler test suite, the auto-grader will use each test case as input
to a set of buggy assemblers.  A test case exposes a buggy assembler by
causing it to generate a different answer from a correct assembler.  The test
suite is graded based on how many of the buggy assemblers were exposed by at
least one test case.  This is known as "mutation testing" in the research
literature on automated testing.

For the simulator test suite, the auto-grader will correctly assemble each
test case, then use it as input to a set of buggy simulators.  A test case
exposes a buggy simulator by causing it to generate a different answer from a
correct simulator.  The test suite is graded based on how many of the buggy
simulators were exposed by at least one test case.  Note that the test cases
for the simulator should all be valid, correct assembly language programs.

Because all programs will be auto-graded, you must be careful to follow the
exact formatting rules in the project description:

    1) (assembler) Follow exactly the format for inputting the assembly-
        language program and outputting the machine-code file.

    2) (assembler) Call exit(1) if you detect errors in the assembly-language
        program.  Call exit(0) if you finish without detecting errors.

    3) (simulator) Don't modify printState or stateStruct at all.  Download
        this handout into your program electronically (don't re-type it) to
        avoid typos.

    4) (simulator) Call printState exactly once before each instruction
        executes and once just before the simulator exits.  Do not call
        printState at any other time.

    5) (simulator) Don't print the sequence "@@@" anywhere
       (except where the provided "printState" function prints it).

    6) (simulator) state.numMemory must be equal to the number of lines in the
        machine-code file.

    7) (simulator) Initialize all registers to 0.

    8) (multiplication) Store the result in register 1.

    9) (multiplication) The two input numbers must be in locations labeled
        "mcand" and "mplier" (lower-case).

8. Turning in the Project

Use the submit370 program to submit your files.  The full name is
/afs/umich.edu/class/eecs370/bin/submit370, but you could add
/afs/umich.edu/class/eecs370/bin/ to your path so you
don't have to keep typing in the full name.  submit370 submits the set of
files associated with a project part (assembler, simulator, multiplication),
and is called as follows:

    submit370 <project-part> <file1> <file2> <file3> ... <filen>

Here are the files you should submit for each project part:
    1) assembler (part 1a)
        a. C program for your assembler (name should end in ".c")
        b. suite of test cases (each test case is an assembly-language program
            in a separate file)

        example:
            submit370 1a assemble.c test1.as test2.as test3.as

    2) simulator (part 1s)
        a. C program for your simulator (name should end in ".c")
        b. suite of test cases (each test case is an assembly-language program
            in a separate file)

        example:
            submit370 1s simulate.c test1.as test2.as

    3) multiplication (part 1m)
        a. assembly program for multiplication

        example:
            submit370 1m mult.as

Your assembler and simulator must each be in a single C file.  We will compile
your program on a Linux workstation using "gcc program.c -lm", so your program
should not require additional compiler flags or libraries.

The official time of submission for your project will be the time the last
file is sent. If you send in anything after the due date, your project will
be considered late (and will use up your late days).  If you have already
used up all of your late days, additional late submissions will not be
scored for your project grade.

9. Code Fragment for Assembler

The focus of this class is machine organization, not C programming skills.  To
"build" your computer, however, you will be doing a lot of C programming.  To
help you, here is a fragment of the C program for the assembler.  This shows
how to specify command-line arguments to the program (via argc and argv), how
to parse the assembly-language file, etc..  This fragment is provided strictly
to help you, though it may take a bit for you to understand and use the file.
You may also choose to not use this fragment.

10. Code Fragment for Simulator

Here is some C code that may help you write the simulator.  Again, you should
take this merely as a hint.  You may have to re-code this to make it do exactly
what you want, but this should help you get started.  Remember not to
change stateStruct or printState.


/* EECS 370 LC-2K Instruction-level simulator */

#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

#define NUMMEMORY 65536 /* maximum number of words in memory */
#define NUMREGS 8 /* number of machine registers */
#define MAXLINELENGTH 1000

typedef struct stateStruct {
    int pc;
    int mem[NUMMEMORY];
    int reg[NUMREGS];
    int numMemory;
} stateType;

void printState(stateType *);

int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    char line[MAXLINELENGTH];
    stateType state;
    FILE *filePtr;

    if (argc != 2) {
        printf("error: usage: %s <machine-code file>\n", argv[0]);
        exit(1);
    }

    filePtr = fopen(argv[1], "r");
    if (filePtr == NULL) {
        printf("error: can't open file %s", argv[1]);
        perror("fopen");
        exit(1);
    }

    /* read in the entire machine-code file into memory */
    for (state.numMemory = 0; fgets(line, MAXLINELENGTH, filePtr) != NULL;
            state.numMemory++) {

        if (sscanf(line, "%d", state.mem+state.numMemory) != 1) {
            printf("error in reading address %d\n", state.numMemory);
            exit(1);
        }
        printf("memory[%d]=%d\n", state.numMemory, state.mem[state.numMemory]);
    }

    return(0);
}

void
printState(stateType *statePtr)
{
    int i;
    printf("\n@@@\nstate:\n");
    printf("\tpc %d\n", statePtr->pc);
    printf("\tmemory:\n");
    for (i=0; i<statePtr->numMemory; i++) {
        printf("\t\tmem[ %d ] %d\n", i, statePtr->mem[i]);
    }
    printf("\tregisters:\n");
    for (i=0; i<NUMREGS; i++) {
        printf("\t\treg[ %d ] %d\n", i, statePtr->reg[i]);
    }
    printf("end state\n");
}


11. C Programming Tips

Here are a few programming tips for writing C programs to manipulate bits:

1) To indicate a hexadecimal constant in C, precede the number by 0x.
For example, 27 decimal is 0x1b in hexadecimal.

2) The value of the expression (a >> b) is the number "a" shifted right by "b"
bits. Neither a nor b are changed. E.g. (25 >> 2) is 6. Note that 25 is 11001
in binary, and 6 is 110 in binary.

3) The value of the expression (a << b) is the number "a" shifted left by "b"
bits. Neither a nor b are changed. E.g. (25 << 2) is 100. Note that 25 is 11001
in binary, and 100 is 1100100 in binary.

4) To find the value of the expression (a & b), perform a logical AND on each
bit of a and b (i.e. bit 31 of a ANDed with bit 31 of b, bit 30 of a ANDed with
bit 30 of b, etc.). E.g.  (25 & 11) is 9, since:

    11001 (binary)
  & 01011 (binary)
---------------------
 =  01001 (binary), which is 9 decimal.

5) To find the value of the expression (a | b), perform a logical OR on each
bit of a and b (i.e. bit 31 of a ORed with bit 31 of b, bit 30 of a ORed with
bit 30 of b, etc.). E.g.  (25 | 11) is 27, since:

    11001 (binary)
  | 01011 (binary)
---------------------
 =  11011 (binary), which is 27 decimal.

6) ~a is the bit-wise complement of a (a is not changed).

Use these operations to create and manipulate machine-code. E.g. to look at bit
3 of the variable a, you might do: (a>>3) & 0x1. To look at bits (bits 15-12)
of a 16-bit word, you could do: (a>>12) & 0xF. To put a 6 into bits 5-3 and a 3
into bits 2-1, you could do: (6<<3) | (3<<1). If you're not sure what an
operation is doing, print some intermediate results to help you debug.
